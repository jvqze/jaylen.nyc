                                All through these years, I grew into an individual who deeply
                                analyzed each and every little thing that crossed my path but found
                                pleasure in taking paths not usually taken. My curiosity nurtured an
                                endless love for computer science, the field challenging me in the
                                very best possible manner. I've spent countless hours diving into
                                projects, some with mainstream technologies like React, while others
                                leverage obscure tools like Lua or frameworks most people don't even
                                know about. In fact, it's rather exciting to work on things that
                                other people find complex or little known, but that is just one of
                                the things that makes it so rewarding for me.

                                        unique technologies it has given me the confidence to push
                                        boundaries. In these moments, that is where I learned how to

                                        human aspect-motivating and troubleshooting a team when
                                        things go wrong, finding creative solutions-has given me
                                        invaluable skills beyond just coding. These experiences have
                                        educated me that I can conquer anything, be it in Computer
                                        Science or in life.

                                        the major factor in my growth concerning computer science
                                        and life in general. Working as part of a team has taught me
                                        to approach problems with flexibility and openness,
                                        considering that each member comes with something different.
                                        I have been accorded many opportunities to work on projects
                                        both at work and at school, whereby striking a balance
                                        between different thinking has paid off in creating creative
                                        solutions. These experiences have taught me how to
                                        communicate, how to overcome obstacles as a team, and how to
                                        appreciate the true meaning of teamwork in achieving
                                        success.

                                Overall, these main motivating factors in my personal and
                                professional development have been helping me in my growth as a
                                person and improving. Leading teams taught me the ways of taking
                                initiative, making confident decisions, and inspiring others to work
                                towards one common goal. At the same time, being part of a team has
                                allowed me to realize the value of collaboration and shared effort.
                                Presently, I have learned how to communicate, listen to other
                                people's perspectives, and balance different personalities. All
                                these experiences not only strengthened my problem-solving and
                                organizing skills but also helped me as a person to become
                                resilient, adaptive, and full of responsibility in everything that I
